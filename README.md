Project Description: 

This project will help in understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the power bi tool.
The Project will consist of 2 modules:
Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python and SQL.
Module 2: Visualizing data using Power bi.
